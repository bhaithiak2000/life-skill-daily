# REST
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used to build web services that allow communication between client and server over HTTP.
It is widely used in modern applications such as web apps, mobile apps, and cloud systems.
## Key Principles of REST
### 1.Stateless Communication
Each request from client to server must contain all required information. The server does not store client session data.
### 2.Client-Server Architecture
The client and server are independent. UI and data storage are separated.
### 3.Uniform Interface
Standard HTTP methods are used:<br>
* GET → Retrieve data
* POST → Create data
* PUT → Update data
* DELETE → Remove data
### 4.Resource-Based  
Everything is treated as a resource (users, orders, products), identified using URLs.
### Why REST is Important for Software Engineers<br>
* Used in almost every modern application
* Helps systems communicate (frontend ↔ backend)
* Required for microservices architecture
* Cloud and mobile applications depend heavily on REST APIs
### Real-World Example
When you open a shopping app:
* The app sends a GET request to fetch product data
* The server sends JSON response
* The app displays products
* This communication happens through REST APIs.
### REST + Life Skills Connection
Building REST services requires:
* Clear documentation
* Team communication
* Understanding client requirements
* This shows how technical knowledge and communication skills work together.
